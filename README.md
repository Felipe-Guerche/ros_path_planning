# ROS Motion Planning

**Robot Motion planning** is a computational problem that involves finding a sequence of valid configurations to move the robot from the source to the destination. Generally, it includes **Path Searching** and **Trajectory Optimization**.

* **Path Searching**: Based on path constraints, such as obstacles, to find the optimal sequence for the robot to travel from the source to the destination without any collisions.

* **Trajectory Planning**: Based on kinematics, dynamics and obstacles, it optimizes the trajectory of the motion state  from the source to the destination according to the path.

This repository provides the implementation of common **Motion Planning** algorithms. The theory analysis can be found at [motion-planning](https://blog.csdn.net/frigidwinter/category_11410243.html). Furthermore, we provide [Python](https://github.com/ai-winter/python_motion_planning) and [MATLAB](https://github.com/ai-winter/matlab_motion_planning) version.
